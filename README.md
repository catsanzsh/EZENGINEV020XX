# EZENGINEV020XX - Mario 64 C++ Port

This repository contains a C++ port of the classic Nintendo 64 game Super Mario 64. This project aims to provide a clean and modern codebase for understanding, modifying, and potentially extending the original game.

## Features

* **C++ Implementation:** The game logic and rendering are implemented in modern C++.
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility (Potentially):** While the original game was for the N64, this port may aim for compatibility with various operating systems (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS). Check the build instructions for supported platforms.
* **Improved Rendering (Potentially):** This port might include enhancements to the rendering pipeline, allowing for higher resolutions, anti-aliasing, and other graphical improvements.
* **Modding Capabilities (Potentially):** A C++ codebase can make it easier to create and integrate mods, custom levels, and other modifications.
* **Learning Resource:** This project serves as an excellent resource for those interested in game engine development, reverse engineering, and the inner workings of Super Mario 64.
